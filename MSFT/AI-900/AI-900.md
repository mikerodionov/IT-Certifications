OD

- Entry-level certification (Fundamentals/900-series), not focused on coding or implementation
- Focus on what technology can do
- AI focus: congnitive services, bots, Azure ML
- Non-AI focus: Microsoft responsible AI principles
- Azure has around 28 cognitive services available

## AI in Azure

### AI overview

AI

- Reasoning - Draw conclusions from imperfect data
- Understanding - Interpret meaning on data such as images, video or audio
- Interacting - Communicate in more natural ways (voice or text)

Common AI wokrloads / Usecases

- Machine learning (prediction/conclusions based on imperfect data - stock price prediction, medical prognosis) / Predictions
- Anomaly detection (credit card fraud detection, equipment failure prediction) / Fraud and failure detection
- Computer vision (interpreting video or image input via classification, object detection or semantic segmentation) / Classify or detect objects
- Natural language processing - NLP (interprent/respond to natural language via key phrase or sentiment detection) / Interpret language
- Converstational AI / Chatbots

AI enablers

- Big data via cheaper and faster storage
- Fast/high compute via GPU and scale-out clusters
- Better algorithms via advancements on AI and ML algorithms

AI entry barriers

- Models are expensive to build, test, and improve (but once built are cheap to consume)
- Entry barriers for smaller companies
- Microsoft strategy for democratizing AI

### Cognitive Services

- Pre-bilt AI models available in Azure
- Allow building AI-infused apps with no ML or AI knowledge
- Highly refined models (Microsoft refined their models on Bing, Skype, X-Box and Cortana)
- Amply programming language support with SDKs and code samples available for .Net, Node.js, Python, Go, Java
- Privacy assured (data not kept after processing, making it easier to comply with data privacy standards such as GDPR; the only exception is some of the Bing APIs where some of the quieries are kept by MSFT to improve their models)
- Low cost, including free tiers

#### Cognitive services pillars

Vision - APIs which can recognize faces, emotions, landmarks, objects & handwriting
Speech - biderectional conversion between text and audio
Language - identify key phrases and understand and translate language
Decision (knowledge) - auotmated choices for content moderation or anomaly detection
Web search - set of Bing APIs for searching web contents

All of the congnitive services pillars/categories have a custom component

- Vision - Custom Vision
- Speech - Speech Studio
- Language - LUIS
- Decision - Content Moderator
- Web Search - Bing Custom Search

#### Congitive Services Decision Workflow

Generic? Y = Use generic service, N = Custom? Y = Use Custom Service, N = Create your own AI model

#### Cognitive Services Lifecycle

- Labs (labs.cognitive.microsoft.com) - can be highly modified before GA or not launched at all (e.g. chatbot personality)
- Public Preview - may change before GA, easy to sign up for (e.g. speaker recognition, anomaly detector)
- GA - generally available service
- Retired/Merged/Branded into new one (e.g. the Emotion API was meged with the Face API)

### The Microsoft responsible AI principles

AI going rouge problem is widely explored in movies.

Microsoft Responsible AI principles

- Fairness (preven biases against certain social groups)
- Reliability and safety (key for medicine, self-driving vehicles)
- Privacy and security (respect for individual privacy, protecting customers' data)
- Inclusiveness (inclusive design practices)
- Transparency (preventing black box effects to fight bias and exclusion practices)
- Accountability (humans is the ultimate responsible for decisions, ability to override AI decision)
