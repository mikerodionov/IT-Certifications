## 101.1 Determine and configure hardware settings

### Pseudo File Systems (PFS)

File System 
- method of laying out files and folders on a physical disk

Pseudo File System
- do not exist on a physical hard disk
- only exist in a RAM while system is running
- on boot kernel creates pseudo file system

In Linux everything is a file/seen as a file - including processes, folders and devices.

Two primary pseudo file system locations in Linux are /proc and /sys

#### /proc

- /proc - contains **PID subfolders**; this PFS contains information about the **processes** running on a system, processes are listed by PID, with HW and process data both in the same directory structure
  - PID folders for processes
    - 1 - first process which starts on system's boot / init process directory, initialization system
      - 1/cmdline - command related to process 1 - systemd
  - cpuinfo file - contains info about CPU, get created in real-time and lives in memory
  - meminfo file
  - partitions file
  - uptime file
  - version file

- /proc PFS is useful source of info about your system and running processes.

#### /sys

- /sys - contains information about the system's **hardware and kernel modules**. No process information listed here.
  - /block
  - /bus
  - /class
  - /dev
  - /devices
  - /firmware
  - /fs - file systems used on machine, - cgroup, xfs etc., inside of FS sub directory we can find partitions sub directory etc.
- hypervisor
    - cgroup
    - pstore
    - resctrl
    - selinux
    - xfs
      - xvda1
        - error
        - log
        - stats - partition's file system statistics
  - /hypervisor
  - /kernel
  - /module
  - /power

**/sys** - HW and kernel info is exposed in plain text files within this PFS/provides info about the kernel (hardware devices and their device drivers) through user space

We can see local documentation on the /proc PFS using *man proc* command.

**Everything is seen by Linux as a file.**

### Working with Kernel Modules

#### Linux Kernel

Linux Kernel
- Core framework of the OS (GNU/Linux)
- Provides a way for the rest of the system to operate with its HW, memory, networking, and itself (Kernel's communication with its various subsystems)
- Linux kernel is **monolythic kernel**
    - Kernel handles all memory management and HW device interactions
    - Extra functionality can be loaded and unloaded dynamically through kernel modules
    - Ensures that the system won't need to be rebooted into different kernel image for added functionality
- Many 3rd-party Linyx kernel modules are device drives

#### uname

```Bash
## uname - returns basic kernel info
uname -m # bitness
uname -rm # kernel release and bitness/machine type
uname -a # all info
# Sample uname -a output
Linux WORKSTATION1 5.10.102.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Wed Mar 2 00:30:59 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

#### lsmod, modinfo, modprobe

```Bash
# lsmod - list modules
lsmod # list Kernel modules, along with modules which are dependent on listed module
# output includes module name, size and used by information - which lists other modules which use this module
modinfo <module name> # get info about specific Kernel module
# Load/unload kernel modules
modprobe -r <module name> # unload Kernel module (use with caution, can break the system)
modprobe <module name> # load Kernel module
```

### Investigating Hardware

#### Linux Device Management

**/dev, udev, D-Bus**

- **/dev** - PFS which contains information on all of the system's connected HW
- **udev service** - Linux service which acts as a device manager for the Linux kernel, links information on system HW to /dev
  - detects newly connected HW (e.g. disk) and passes info about it through dbus service to /dev PFS
- **D-Bus service** - data bus service, sends data messages between application, a conduit of information about what is going on in the system, udev utilizes dbus to notify users and the system when new HW is attached
  - passes all information about everything that goes on within the Linux system to other services and devices
  - new device gets attached to /dev PFS which contains actual handles to all devices that connected to the system
  - other apps trying to access HW, e.g. disk with lsblk (ls block, to list all the block devices) it goes through D-Bus to /dev PFS to get info about device

**/dev**

/dev/cpu - numbered subfolders for each CPU core, microcode
/dev/dri - video cards
/dev/nvme0 - SSD disk
/dev/nvme0n1 - SSD disk
/dev/nvme0n1p1 - SSD disk partition
/dev/sda - USB hard drive

#### Listing devices - lspci, lsusb, lscpu, lsblk

```Bash
# lspci - Displays information on PCI devices attached
lspci # lists all PCI devices currently attached to the system (queries /dev and returns what is connected to PCI bus) - USB controllers, NICs, memory controller, sound/video cards, card riders etc.
lspci -k # to see which HW components use which Kernel modules (Kernel driver in use, Kernel modules)
lspci -k -v # to see even more info (verbose) - capabilities
# lsusb - Displays information on USB devices attached
lsusb # to list all USB devices attached to the system (disks, root hubs/controllers)
lsusb -v # verbose
lsusb -t # tree view to see which USB device attached to which controller
# lscpu - Displays information on processors on a system
lscpu # list CPU info
# lsblk - Displays information on all block devices on a system
lsblk # list hard disks (block devices) - NAME / MAJ-MIN / SIZE / RO / TYPE / MOUNTPOINT
lsblk -f # to get file system used by each partition (FSTYPE)
```

#### Recap - 101.1 Determine and configure hardware settings

**sysfs** - is a pseudo file system that provides information about the kernel (such as hardware devices and their device drivers) through user space. The sysfs filesystem is **commonly mounted at /sys**. Typically, it is mounted automatically by the system.

**/proc** - is a pseudo file system that contains the processes that are currently running on the system, each with their own directory named after their PID. 

**udev** - is a device manager service for Linux.

**modprobe** - this command loads a kernel module into memory.
**modprobe -r <module name>** - this command unloads Kernel module (use with caution, can break the system)

**lsusb** - this command allows to view the hot-pluggable devices currently connected to your system; USB devices are considered hot pluggable (or hot swappable), and this command lists those that are connected to your system. 

## 101.2 Boot the System

### The Linux Boot Sequence

#### The Linux Boot Process (Simplified)

- **Machine power on**
- **BIOS** - checks all the HW and IO devices, once checks complete boot process begin
- **Boot sector on first hard drive** - boot program, most frequently **GRUB (Grand Unified Boot Loader)** on modern Linux distros looks for HDD section containing the data needed to boot an OS, and loads the Linux Kernel
- **Linux Kernel** - Linux Kerner loads an Initial RAM Disk
- **Initial RAM Disk** - contains drivers and starts to load drivers and then mount the file system from HDD, once Kernel is fully loaded it starts initialization system
- **Init system** - starts services/daemons, once started it takes over mounting file systems and at this point initial RAM disk is no longer needed and gets removed, init system continues loading services and gets machine to the state when it is fully ready to use

#### Boot Logs

dmesg - the traditional utility used for viewing the kernel ring buffer
journalctl-k - systemd utility to view the kernel ring buffer within the systemd journal

- These logs are volatile - gets overwritten on every reboot
- Generated from an are known as the **Kernel Ring Buffer** - RAM area to which Kernel wrties all its system messages
- dmesg - shows info on the HW that kernel can see and how it activates it, low level memory management messages; typically used to see if HW is getting recognized by the Linux Kernel (when it may not be recongnized by udev or not show up in /dev PFS); considered to be legacy command to pull up information from Kernel Ring Buffer
- journalctl - on most of the modern Linux distributions systemd is used instead of old init system amd with it journalctl command can be used - it logs every event occurring within the system, part of those logged events are kernel messages (the same which can be seen with dmesg command); to view kernel messages we use *journalctl -k* (k switch indicates that we want to see all kernel messages)

### init

#### init basics

- init - short for initialization
- based on the System V init used in UNIX systems
- sysvinit - written by Miquel Van Smoorenburg
- services are started one after the other, sequentially/in a serial fashion - that approach was choosen for the sake of simplicity

#### init startup

- when Linux kernel is loaded and initial RAM disk is created it looks up for initialization system to hand over control to it
- **/sbin/init** - first place where kernel looks up for initialization system, once init program is located its get started and takes control
- **/etc/inittab** - once started init reads configuration from /etc/inittab file
- init reads /etc/inittab file to determine what **runlevel** the system should be operating in (predefined configuration)
- each runlevel starts and/or stops scripts for various services dependin on how the system should be set up
- **system can operate in 1 runlevel at a time**, runlevel applies to the system as a whole / **system-wide option**

#### Linux Runlevels (based on Linux Standards v4.1, some Linux distros such as Slackware and Gentoo use slightly different configuration)

| Runlevel | Purpose                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| 0        | Halt                                    |
| 1        | Single-user mode                        |
| 2        | Multi-user mode without networking      |
| 3        | Multi-user mode with networking         |
| 4        | unused                                  |
| 5        | Multi-user mode with networking and GUI |
| 6        | Reboot                                  |

- 0 - **Halt/Shutdown** level - init run scripts that stop services and powers off the system
- 1 - **Single user mode** level, typically the root is the only user allowed to login into the system at the run level, primarily used for maintenance tasks and repair functionality
- 2 - **Multi-user mode without networking** (all interfaces are down, no remote FS are mounted)
- 3 - **Multi-user mode with networking**, historically most Linux servs were setup to run at this level by default
- 4 - Typically **not used**, but **available if admin want to setup a custom runlevel environment**
- 5 - **Multi-user with networking and GUI**, older Linux workstation with desktop environment were configured to run in level 5 by default
- 6 - **Reboot** runlevel, init stops services and restarts the system going through complete boot up sequence once again

#### inittab file

- /etc/inittab
- <identifier>:<runlevel>:<action>:<process> 
- id:3:initdefault (no action)
- si::sysinit:/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit (action rc.sysinit, no runlevel as it is init process)
- each line specifies a runlevel

10:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 0
10:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 1
10:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 2
10:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 3
10:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 4
10:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 5
10:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 6

wait - the process specified will be started once when runlevel is entered, and init will wait for its termination

Boot sequence

- Boot partition found - Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83
- Kernel and initial RAM disk are loaded - kernel, initrd
- Kernel pulls initial drivers and set up tools from RAM disk
- Kernel hands the system over to /sbin/init - first place where kernel looks up for initialization system, to locate init system
- init reads configuration from /etc/inittab file and performs system maintenance tasks from /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
- once init has read the initdefault line in /etc/inittab, it enters runlevel 3 and starts up scripts corresponding to this level
- once all scripts and services are loaded the system is ready for use

```Bash
# RedHat based - /etc/rc.d
# Debian based - /etc/init.d
# rc = run commands
ls /etc/rc.d
init.d
rc
rc.sysinit # script that does some house cleaning before we enter into specific runlevel defined in the inittab file
rc.local # run after the runlevel is completely loaded, usually customized by the sys admin to start up extra services or tasks which do not have their own init scripts
# rc0 - rc6 directories pertain to specific runlevels
# inside we can se symbolic links to original script files located under etc/init.d
# symlinks are named in a specific way - begin with K letter (indicate that services that are to be killed) and S (scripts/services to be started), then NN number which indicates numerical order in which these scripts will be killed and started
# e.g. ip6tables and iptables are started before network is started etc.
rc0.d
rc1.d
rc2.d
rc3.d
rc4.d
rc5.d
rc6.d
# View symlinks
ls -l /etc/rc3.d/
```

init
- /etc/init.d - directory that contains the scripts for the services on the system
- /etc/init.d/rc - script that orchestrates how the runlevel scripts run and what occurs when a runlevel changes

### upstart

#### Upstart key characteristics/background

Upstart init daemon was made popular by Ubuntu distribution.

- First developed for Ubuntu in 2006 by Scott Remnant
- First uses in Ubuntu 6.10
- Eventually included in RedHat Enterprise Linux 6, Debian and Fedora 9
- Design goal - abiltity to start and stop services in asynchronous fashion
- Unlike init, upstart is capable to start service asynchronously which decreases boot up times
- Upstart works with real-time events, which init was not designed to understand
  - Upstart not only stop and start services but also monitors their availability (can restart service when it stops unexpectedly)

#### init VS upstart - Boot Sequence

init:    **/sbin/init** > /etc/inittab > /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit > /etc/rc.d/rcX.d (in sequential order) > login
upstart: **/sbin/init** > startup event (man page 7) > mountall (8) 
                                                 > /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf > telinit (8) > runlevel (7) command to switch to default runlevel (not the same as System V init runlevel) > /etc/init/rc.conf > login

* Upstart daemon is named init as well for backward compatibility with the kernel.
* Some of the upstart components work in parallel to reduce boot time

upstart boot sequence (simplified):

- /sbin/init - Linux kernel looking for initialization daemon named init within /sbin directory, and upstart is named init to support this
- startup - upstart initialization daemon then fires off the **startup event**
- mountall - startup event checks and mounts the drives that make up file system using mountall tool
- load HW drivers - startup event loads HW drivers
- /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf - as FSs come online startup runs /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf script which checks to see if there is an **/etc/inittab** file to see if there are any configuration options set there
- /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf calls **telinit** to switch into default runlevel via the **runlevel command**
- **runlevel command** - starts many other jobs from upstart to get the system ready and also provides compatibility mechanism to legacy scripts which may require specific run levels by executing **/etc/init/rc.conf job** and passing the expected run level as an argument
- after startup event begins there are multiple other jobs that are runningin parallel which are not mentioned above

#### upstart Service Monitoring

- init is static; it does not natively respon to changes on a system
- upstart is dynamic, it can respond to changes on the system
- A change on a Linux system is an event (new monitor plugged in, etc.)
- Events trigger jobs
- Jobs fall into 2 categories
  - Tasks - perform task and return to waiting state on completion
  - Services - do not stops by itself (only stops in response to event call)

waiting - initial job state waits for events
starting - job is about to start
running - job is currently running
stopping - job has processed its prestop configuration section
killed - job is stopping
post-stop - job is stopped
reswapping - occurs when something goes wrong with job/when it quits unexpectedly while in running state, upstart will attempt to respawn the job up to 10 times with 5 second intervals before job gets dropped entirely

Currently no Linux distribution are using upstart anymore - upstart just an illustration of init system which introduced move from static start/shutdown mechanism to a one which is aware of what's going on in the system and reacts to changes/events.

### systemd

#### systemd - Getting rid of shell scripts

- init and parts of upstart rely on Bash shell scripts
- systemd removed the need to have shell scripts which have to be run through Bash interpreter which implied spawning spawning new processes for each command within the shell script (each of these processes then have to open up a library file requred by command) which lead to an inefficient use of time
- systemd replaces most of the functionality of the shell scripts with equivalent functionality written in compiled C code
- still compatible with older System V init scripts
  - NOTE: the creators of systemd have emphasized that it is not 100% compatible (close to 99%) with old init system, as it was very extensible and there is no compatibility developed for every possible scenario
- instead of old bash init scripts systemd uses unit files

#### Uniy File Locations

3 main locations - default or package install/admin/runtime:
- Default location provided by package installations - **/usr/lib/systemd/system**
  - do not edit these unit files, as they can potentially be modified by package updates
- Unit file location for system administrators (these take precedence over those in /usr) - **/etc/systemd/system**
- Runtime unit files - **/run/systemd/system**

To view all unit files on a system: 

```Bash
systemctl list-unit-files
```

#### Components of the Unit File

- Unit files follow the INI style format first seen in MS-DOS, lines:
  - [Unit]
  - Description=Multi-User System
  - Documentation=man:systemd.special(7)
  - Requires-basic.target
    - or Wants=(more robust)
  - Conflicts=rescue.service rescue.target
  - After=basic.target rescue.service rescue.target
- man 5 systemd.unit - full documentation on the systemd unit file
- systemctl cat something.unit - will print out the contents of the unit file specified, e.g. *systemctl cat httpd.service*

#### systemd is the new init

systemd boot sequence
- The kernel still looks for /sbin/init
- systemd just took the place of /sbin/init (via symbolic link /sbin/init > /lib/systemd/systemd)

### Recap - 101.2 Boot the System

#### sysvinit runlevels

- 0 - **Halt/Shutdown** level - init run scripts that stop services and powers off the system
- 1 - **Single user mode** level, typically the root is the only user allowed to login into the system at the run level, primarily used for maintenance tasks and repair functionality
- 2 - **Multi-user mode without networking** (all interfaces are down, no remote FS are mounted)
- 3 - **Multi-user mode with networking**, historically most Linux servs were setup to run at this level by default
- 4 - Typically **not used**, but **available if admin want to setup a custom runlevel environment**
- 5 - **Multi-user with networking and GUI**, older Linux workstation with desktop environment were configured to run in level 5 by default / aka X11
- 6 - **Reboot** runlevel, init stops services and restarts the system going through complete boot up sequence once again

#### Linux boot order/sequence

BIOS > Boot Sector (with the Boot Loader), Kernel, Initial RAM Disk, Device Initialization

Commands to view output from the kernel ring buffer

- *journalctl -k* - systemd journal command lets you view kernel messages from the ring buffer
- *dmesg* - displays text from the kernel ring buffer

#### Linux Initialization systems

- **sysvinit** - classic initialization system used on Linux systems, written by Miquel Van Smoorenburg, services are started one after the other, sequentially/in a serial fashion - that approach was choosen for the sake of simplicity
- **upstart** - replacement initialization system originally developed for the Ubuntu distribution

**/sbin/init** - binary used by kernel to bring up the rest of the system and start services / first place where kernel looks up for initialization system, to locate init system

Initial RAM disk
- Gets unmounted when init system takes over and mounts the computer's file systems

## 101.3 Change Runlevels/Boot Targets and Shutdown or Reboot the System

### Change Your Working Environment - Runlevels

#### Runlevel Review

Runlevels available in a classic systemv and upstart systems

- 0 - **halt/shutdown**
- 1 - **single user mode**
- 2 - **multi-user mode without networking**
- 3 - **multi-user mode with networking**
- 4 - **unused** (for custom environments)
- 5 - **multi-user with networking and GUI**
- 6 - **reboot**

#### Runlevel Commands

Runlevel commands available in a classic systemv and upstart systems

```Bash
runlevel # view your current runlevel, N 3 output - N means that there was no previous runlevel and number is a current run level
telinit # change to another runlevel
init N # change to another runlevel, requires root (su -)
```
Changing runlevels at boot - interrupt the GRUB boot process by pressing any key during startup, then at the GRUB selection menu, highlight a kernel to modify, press the "a" key to add arguments to the end of a kernel line, enter in a runlevel number

### Change Your Working Environment - targets

Components of the Unit File

- systemctl cat something.unit, e.g. systemctl cat https service - this will print out the contents of the unit file specified

```
```
>>>

### Recap - 101.3 Change Runlevels/Boot Targets and Shutdown or Reboot the System

```Bash
telinit # changes to a different runlevel specified as a parameter
telinit 1 # puts the computer into runlevel 1 = preventing anyone except the root user from logging in, TEMPORARILY
telinit 3 # puts the computer into runlevel 3 = multi-user command line environment with network access, TEMPORARILY
runlevel # shows you the current runlevel (and the previous one if available) on a machine using sysvinit
## PERMANENTLY set a computer to boot into mutli-user shell so that this setting persists after reboot
systemctl set-default multi-user.target # configures a systemd system to boot into a multi-user command line environment with network access
/etc/inittab # set the first directive to id:3:initdefault = configures sysvinit system to boot into runlevel 3 = a multi-user command line environment with network access
## systemd reboot
systemctl reboot # shorthand way of isolating the reboot.target
systemctl isolate reboot.target # explicitly changes the computer's environment to the reboot target, which in turn reboots the system
## notify other users about reboot
wall "This computer will be rebooted in 5 minutes" # wall command is used to broadcast a message to all users on a system
## system shutdown
shutdown -h -t now # immediate shutdown
systemctl isolate shutdown.target # shutdown on a systemd machine
```

## 103.4 Use Streams, Pipes and Redirects

### Understanding Standard Input, Output and Error

Standard Output

- All UNIX-like OSs have something like a bucket where all output goes
- This "bucket" is called Standard Output
- Abbreviated as "stdout"
- File handle number 1

Redirecting Standard Output

- We can use special characters to intercept information before it gets to "stdout"
- Characters: >, >>

Standard Input

- Input into a process or application usually comes from entries made on the keyboard
- Files and standard output from other commands can provide input to another command
- Special characters: <, | (less than, pipe)
- Abbreviated as stdin
- File handle number 0

```Bash
# Standard Input examples
wc test.sh # input comes form keyboard
wc < test.sh # input comes from file
cat /etc/passwd | less # input comes from stdout of cat command
```

Standard Error

- Abbreviated as "stderr"
- Typically written to the screen 
- File hanle number 2 (stdin - 0, stdout - 1)

```Bash
# Redirecting examples using file handle/stream numbers
script.sh # stderr goes to the screen
script.sh 2> error.log # stderr gets redirected to error.log file
script.sh 2>&1 | less # stderr & stdout gets sent as stdin to the less command
```

### Redirecting Output to Screen and File

More Redirect Options

```Bash
# Write stdout to file
echo "data" > myfile.txt
# Append stdout to file
echo "data2" >> myfile.txt
# Redirect stdin with <
cat < myfile.txt
# Pipe stdout from one command to another
cat /etc/passwd | less
```

tee

- reads data from stdin, and writes that data to stdout and files
- useful for chaining together long commands and viewing output at various stages

```Bash
# -d = only directories
ls -d /usr/share/doc/lib[Xx]*
# pipe output to the tee which will output to the screen and to a file
ls -d /usr/share/doc/lib[Xx]* | tee
# pattern - command | tee file | command | tee file | command | tee file
ls -d /usr/share/doc/lib[Xx]* | tee lib-docs.txt | sort -r | tee lib-docs-rev.txt
```

xargs

- accepts input from stdin and other commands
- commonly used with the *find* command (but can be used with other commands as well)

```Bash
# Look up for empty files
find test/ -empty
# pipe stdout to xargs whcich will use it as options for another command
find test/ -empty | xargs rm -f
# get file names containing text pattern and passing it to args to execute mv command
# {} individual file name returned by previous command
grep -l "junk" test/file_* | xargs -I {} mv {} test/bak/

# Locate any .sh file in home dir, and use xargs to get file attributes and redirect this output to file
find ~ -name "*.sh" | xargs ls -al > scripts.txt
```

### Recap - Understanding Standard Input, Output and Error

```Bash
# stdout redirect character >
# stdout redirect appending >>
*command > output.log 2>&1* # send both the stdout of a command, and stderr, into a file called output.log
find / -name "*.bak" | xargs -I {} mv {} backup/ # find *.bak and move to backup directory
date 2> /dev/null | tee out.log # print today's date to the screen, send any errors to /dev/null, and write the output of the command to a file called out.log
# as tee expects input/stdin we use pipe

# Display file content on the screen/stdout
cat < list.txt # sending file to stdin of cat command
cat list.txt
```

## 103.5 Create, Monitor, and Kill Processes

### Reviewing state of your system

### Monitoring processes

### Keep a process running

```Bash
killall # kills all processes based on a name provided as an argument
watch # runs a command at a specified interval, used to monitor a command's output
screen # a terminal window manager that allows you to run command in an isolated session
tmux # a modern terminal windows manager (like screen) with extra features

# pgrep - pgrep looks through the currently running processes and lists the process IDs which match the selection criteria to stdout.
pgrep -a httpd # grep processes
sudo killall httpd
pgrep -a httpd
# specific signal can be specified using -s switch
sudo killall -s 9 httpd

# watch - allows to run app and periodically re-run it and send output to the screen
watch date # Ctr+C to stop, by default re-run every 2 seconds
# custom interval can be specified using -n option
watch -n 5 date
# watch is often useful in combination with ls command to monitor file growth

## screen & tmux - useful when connection is instable as your process will keep running inside of detached session to which you can later reconnect

# screen - starts a session, run command and detach/re-attach
screen # starts new session
watch -n 3 date
# Ctrl+a d - to detach from the session
screen -r # re-attach
# multiple screen sessions can be started
screen -ls
screen -r NNN # re-attach to specific session by its ID (NNN.pts)
exit # to exit screen session

# tmux
tmux # puts you into new shell, with task bar below
ssh user@192.168.10.11
# Ctrl+b d to detach
tmux ls # list tmux sessions
tmux attach-session -t 0 # re-connect to the session

nohup # a command that is preceded by nohup receives signal 1 (NOHUP) so that should be a terminal window close, the process will still run as long as the login session is not tetminated; i.e. it will be running unless you log out (surviving closing of terminal window)
# we use & to send command into background
# & - when applied to the end of a command, the command is sent to the background returning the use of the shell to the user
nohup ping www.google.com & # hit enter twice, PID will be returned
jobs # use jobs command to see a list of all jobs that are running in the background
jobs -l # list jobs
# job output is srnt to hohup.out file
tail -f nohup.out
fg # brings a job that runs in the background into the foreground
# Ctrl + z sends job back to background - but job will be paused, to force job to keep running we use bg % job N
bg # sends a job to the background while it keeps running
bg %N # force job resube for job N
kill NNNN # can be used to kill the job process by ID which we can get with jobs -l command
