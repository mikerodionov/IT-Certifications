# LPIC1 Course Notes

## DAY 01

VirtualBox

Alma Linux/Debian
Rocky/Debian

No GUI - 98% of certification focused on CLI
How to install GUI via CLI 

Recommended distro: for LPIC1 any distro is OK

Fedora
Ubuntu - is less recommended for LPIC1 certification, focused on ease of use - introducing distro specific tools (snap, plan)
RedHat
Debian
CentOS
Linux Mint
Rocky Linux
Alma Linux
Open SuSe

Ubuntu ll alias - ll is aliased to `ls -alF'

```Bash
# To view alias target
type <ALIAS>
type ll
# ll is aliased to `ls -alF

# -a, --all - do not ignore entries starting with .
ls -a

# sh prompt - $
# bash prompt - username@HOSTNAME:~$

```

### Exam Content

101: System Architecture
102: Linux Installation and Package Management

### Essential commands

```Bash
# Current user
whoami
# Current host
hostname
# Path to working directory
pwd
# Help
## Usage manual
man
## Read info documents - information
info
## help command - when no man, whereis do not display location for such commands
help <command>
help fg
### those command are "shell bulletin"
type fg
### others are "hashed"
type mkdir
## --help switch for command

# Check whether it is file or directory and identify file type
file filename

# man section
# It is possible to create man files for your own commands/scripts or edit existing man files
# /usr/share/man - default main man directory, with sub-directories for man sections
# 1 : User command (executable programs or shell commands)
# 2 : System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
# 3 : Library calls (functions within program libraries)
# 4 : Special files (usually found in /dev)
# 5 : File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
# 6 : Games
# 7 : Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions),
# 8 : System administration commands (usually only for root)
# 9 : Kernel routines [Non standard]
```

In Linux everythnig is file.

Use of vi is an exam topic (103.8 Basic file reading).

- grep
- egrep
- fgrep
- sed
- regex

Certification is focused on bash interpreter.

### Bash KB shortcuts

### history

Stored in .bash_history hidden file (ls -A). Stored in memory when session closes correctly/gracefully (with exit) it gets written into .bash_history file - 1 file per user, from multiple sessions (reload on session start).

```Bash
# Clear up history - session buffer clear up
# for full clearup clear both buffer and file
history -c
# Specific line removal
history -d N
# Removing history file
rm -r .bash_history
# cat concatenates
cat .bash_history
# fmt allows formatting
fmt .bash_history
```

```Bash
# which only searches for executables / where does this command comes from? - Returns full path of (shell) commands
which ls
# whereis searches for any files - locates binary, source, and man page files for a command
whereis ls
```

**sudo = Switch User and Do**

```Bash
# sudo elevation - switch user and do
sudo COMMAND
# switch to sudo user
sudo su
# System info
uname -a

# echo
# double quotes - vars expanded
echo "This is my $HOME"
# single quotes - vasrs not expanded, literal output
echo 'This is my $HOME'

# alias
alias ALIAS=COMMAND
# to make it persistent add alias to bash.rc
```

## DAY 02

rm .bash_history

### Absolute/relative paths

Absolute path - starts from root /, in Win from drive letter.

In Linux we have 1 root, in Windows every drive has its own separate root starting from drive level (no common root).

### Data flows

Data flows/channels.

stdin[0] - input stream
stdout[1] - output stream
stderr[2] - error stream

```Bash
echo "Hola mundo"
# Write to txt file, overwriting existing file
echo "Hola mundo" > out.txt
# Write to txt file, appending to existing file
echo "Hola mundo" >> out.txt
# Below will output error to stderr[2] and nothing to file/stdout[1]
echno "Hola mundo" > out.txt
# Sending to 2 streams
find / -name interfaces 1> match.txt 2> error.txt
```

```Bash
/usr/bin/df -hT | grep -v loop
```

**/dev/null** - "black hole" - discards everything you send into it

Pipe - pass stdout of one command to stdin of another one.

ifconfig - deprecated package, alternative ip.

tr command - translate/delete characters, can be useful to replace space with some other symbol (" " > ";") to see more easily double spaces.

```Bash
# Replace char/letter
echo "Hola" | tr "H" "Z"
```

cut command - cut part of the file based on specified delimiter and column N ()

grep - print out lines which match patterns
```Bash
# Look up for user
cat /etc/passwd | grep mikhail
# Count cosequtive unique lines
uniq -c
# Order to make data consequtive
sort
```

/var/log/secure

### Aliases

alias - shows configured aliases


~/.bashrc, inside of it:

if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases
fi

~/.bash_aliases

### Check/ban IP

https://www.ripe.net/ - entity which manages public IPs in EU, Russia

ripe.dm

whois

fail2ban
https://www.arsys.es/blog/instalar-fail2ban

/var/log/auth.log

clear / ctrl + L - clears screen by scrolling up
reset - deletes

### 103.2 Process text streams using filters

less is interactive command, you will need to exit yourself

less
/word_to_search

more is noninteractive command it exists itself

more

head
tail

tail -f

tac - cat backwards :)


```Bash
bzcat
cat
cut
head
less
md5sum
nl
od
paste
sed
sha256sum
sha512sum
sort
split
tail
tr
# uniq counts only consequitive lines as occurences, non consequtives will be counted separately
# can be used in combination with sort to workaround non-consequitive occurrences problem
uniq
wc
xzcat
zcat

# Number file lines, enter/line return counts for new line for the system
nl
cat -n file.txt
# in vi set list command will show line return as $ / set nolist to disable this
# cat -e to show end of line as $
cat -e file.txt

# sort by column, -n to specify numeric sort
sort -k 2 -t":" -n data.txt
# -R for random sort
alias voluntarion='sort -R students | head -l'
```

### Packaging/compression

Packaging - tar - no compression, just package into one file
Compression - gzip, bzip2, xz

To group files into package you package them, then compress

tar czf package.tar file*

File globbing VS regular expressions

Parameters: - Unix style, -- GNU style

## DAY 03

```Bash
ls /tmp/
mv /dir1/file1 /dir2/file2
# -f to suppress confirmation prompt
mv -f /dir1/file1 /dir2/file2
# "mv -i" = interactive = ask for confirmation, on RedHat distros mv is an alias to "mv -i"
# to create multple sub dirs _101, _102, etc.
#  -p, --parents - no error if existing, make parent directories as needed
mkdir -p lpi/exam_{101,102,201,202}/topics
# Remove the DIRECTORY(ies), if they are empty.
rmdir
# Remove directory with files
rm -rf /dir
# ls
#  -A, --almost-all - do not list implied . and ..
# -h, --human-readable - with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K 234M 2G etc.

# File Globbing, 3 types of globs (aka wildcards)
# * - any combination of any number of characters
# ? - any single character
# [] - matches the combination by exactly one character [A2] will return anything that contains A or 2
# ! - exclamation mark excludes characters from the list within the square bracket [!BC]
# ranges [a-z] and [0-9]

# grep with regex
# ^ beginning of a line
# $ end of a line
# all commented lines
grep "^#"
# all except comments - use -v = invert match
# remove comments (grep -v "^#") and empty lines (grep -v "^$")
cat .bashrc | grep -v "^#" | grep -v "^$"
grep -v "^#" .bashrc | grep -v "^$"

# File globbing VS regular expressions

# Search any number of spaces with end of line (empty line with N spaces) * = 0 to N occurrences
grep "^ *$" test.txt
# Eleminate such lines
grep -v "^ *$" test.txt

grep [3-5] /etc/passwd

# . any character in specific position only "1.3" will match 123, 113, 153 etc.
# .* - asterisk refers back to preceding char = any char any number of times from 0 to N

# Extended regular expressions
# grep -E =  -E, --extended-regexp PATTERNS are extended regular expressions
# +, ? - 1 or N times occurrence of preceding char or pattern, {} - number of repetition of preceeding char or pattern
# {1,3} = {min,max}

# () - groups of patterns
# Search for IPv4
# Look for 1 or 3 digits followed by literal dot and repeat 3 times
grep -E "([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}" test.txt
# 
grep -E "([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}" test.txt

# | - use more than one pattern (one or another)
grep -vE "^$|^#" test.txt

# non system users will have UID above 1000
# Users with home dir
 grep home.* /etc/passwd
```

#### 103.8 Basic file editing

```Bash
# Opening multiple "windows" inside of the same terminal
tmux
screen
# Ctrl + B, c - create, n - navigate, d - detach
tmux new -s "TMP"
tmux list-sessions
tmux a "TMP"
```

# inode - Linux FS works with inodes - structures which contain files' metadata which include pointers list
# Linux must allocate an index node (inode) for every file and directory in the filesystem. Inodes do not store actual data. Instead, they store the metadata where you can find the storage blocks of each fileâs data.
# Check the inode number in a specific file

# bashtop
bashtop

# ps - report a snapshot of the current processes, within current session
# ps -ax - report a snapshot of the current processes, within all sessions

# who - Print information about users who are currently logged in.

# zombie process - process which is not terminated and do not have parent process, state code Z
# S - sleep
ps -ax
ps -ax -o pid,stat | grep Z

ps -ax | grep ping

ps -ax -o pid,ppid,tty,cmd | grep PID

# zombie clear up

# kill -2 = send signal 2 ~ Ctrl +C, do not work for processes running in foreground
# kill -19 = pause process
# kill -18 = resume process

# jobs -  Lists the active jobs.  JOBSPEC restricts output to that job.
# Without options, the status of all active jobs is displayed.
jobs --help

# fg PID - bring process to foreground

# Kill key statuses
# 2 - SIGINT - the signal sent when we press Ctrl+C. The default action is to terminate the process. However, some programs override this action and handle it differently; "interruption request sent by the user"
# 9 - SIGKILL - "kill"; When a process receives SIGKILL it is terminated. This is a special signal as it canât be ignored and we canât change its behavior.
# We use this signal to forcefully terminate the process. We should be careful as the process wonât be able to execute any clean-up routine.
# 15 - SIGTERM - "exit"; terminate the process but specifically requesting to finish it, SIGTERM is the default signal when we use the kill command. When we send SIGTERM, the process sometimes executes a clean-up routine before exiting and it also can be handled to ask for confirmation
# 18 - SIGCONT - "continue" 
# 19 - SIGSTOP - "pause"
```

```Bash
# Loop example
for i in apple manazana orange ; do echo $i ; done
```

## DAY05

File permissions

chmod

9 bits, 3 groups [---][---][---]

- owner rwx
- group owner rwx
- others rwx

```Bash
# To see user ID and user's groups IDs
id username
# Remove execute rights
sudo chmod -x /usr/bin/firefox
# View permissions
# Current dir
ls -ld
# Specific file within current dir
ls -ld file1.txt
# X permission required to traverse directory content ~ access to a directory (user will be able to view directory contentent but not to enter into it
# In Linux directory is a file which contains 2 columns - resource/file name and corresponding i-node number
# Root directory is always i-node 2, all others have random number
# To view file in directory we look into folder i-node and then move on to file i-node
# Directory R = check directory content
# Directory X = access directory conten
```

Permission management - symbolic notation or base-8 notation (0-7)

| base-8 | binary | RWX |
|--------|--------|-----|
| 0      | 000    | --- |
| 1      | 001    | --x |
| 2      | 010    | -w- |
| 3      | 011    | -wx |
| 4      | 100    | r-- |
| 5      | 101    | r-x |
| 6      | 110    | rw- |
| 7      | 111    | rwx |

```Bash
# Change file owner
chown user file
```

Symbolic notation

Useful when you need to add/remove permissions for entity

echo 'echo "Hello world!"' > script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh

Entities
u - User
g - Group
o - Owner

Operations
+ - add
- - remove
= - set

Permissions
r - Red
w - Write
x - Execute

./ - reference to current directory

```Bash
# Look for files with 777 permissions
find /etc/ -type -f perm 777
# touch - updates 3 time stamps of existing file (access, modify, change) but not birt time stamp
touch file1.txt
stat file1.txt
```

Change group ownner

```Bash
# Change the group of each FILE to GROUP.
chgrp
# With chown
chown :group file
```

Practice:

```Bash
# PART1
# Obtener la MAC del interface ens3 usando el comando ip address show
ip a show eth0 | grep -Eoh '[a-fA-F0-9]{2}(:[a-fA-F0-9]{2}){5}' | grep -v 'ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff'

### Topic 102: Linux Installation and Package Management

#### 102.1 Design hard disk layout

### Topic 104: Devices, Linux Filesystems, Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

#### 104.1 Create partitions and filesystems

GRUB - Linux boot manager
NTLOADER - Windows boot manager

Hardware boot up
- BIOS POST

HDD physical structure
- Spindle
- Track t
- Sector s
- Cylinder c
- Platter
- Arm

SSD also have physical sectors - blocks, 512 bytes

Parked read-write head are alwats in 0/0/0 (track/sector/cylinder)

1st sector of disk is called MBR and it stores boot loader.

UEFI

[About Solid State Drives (SSD)](https://www.oo-software.com/en/docs/whitepaper/whitepaper_ssd.pdf)

SSD layout

In contrast to the hard disk, a SSD consists of semiconductor memory building blocks, it contains no mechanical parts. The smallest unit of an SSD is a page, which is composed of several memory cells, and is usually 4 KB in size. Several pages on the SSD are summarized to a block. A block is the smallest unit of access on a SSD. Currently, 128 pages are mostly combined into one block; therefore, a block contains 512 KB.

Hard disk alignment

CHS (cylinder head sector) alignment

The alignment on cylinder head sector indicates an addressing method that introduces the geometry of the hard disk with the hard disk controller. This allows it to read data from a disk or write to one.

SSD alignment

Unlike hard disks, SSDs use a different algorithm to determine the first logical sector. The data are always read and written in blocks. Therefore, partitions / volumes need to always be aligned in blocks on SSDs. From Microsoft Windows Vista on a non - CHS orientation is supported by Windows. In the registry under
âHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\SERVICES\VDS\ALIGNMENTâ are default values, which can be modified by the administrator. From a disk size of 4 GB on, the values stored are 1 MB. This value, 1 MB, is a multiple of the standard block size of 512 KB for SSDs and a multiple of 64KB at a CHS alignment. In this way, Windows ensures that both disks can work optimally.

sudo fdisk -l

4 primary partitions
1 primary partition can be converted to extended, so that 3 logic partitions can be created within it

###  Loop device

In Unix-like operating systems, a loop device, vnd (vnode disk), or lofi (loop file interface) is a pseudo-device that makes a computer file accessible as a block device. Before use, a loop device must be connected to an extent file in the file system. The association provides the user with an application programming interface (API) that allows the file to be used in place of a block special file (cf. device file system). Thus, if the file contains an entire file system, the file may then be mounted as if it were a disk device.

Files of this kind are often used for CD ISO images and floppy disk images. Mounting a file containing a file system via such a loop mount makes the files within that file system accessible. They appear in the mount point directory.

```Bash
# Partitioning
fdisk
gdisk
parted
# UI/frontend which calls other commands (fdisk & mkfs)
gparted
# mke2fs
mkfs
```

### System installation and folders

On Ubuntu clean install su - does not work/as root user is inactive.

```Bash
# df - Show information about the file system on which each FILE resides, or all file systems by default.
# -h, --human-readable  print sizes in powers of 1024 (e.g., 1023M)
# -H, --si              print sizes in powers of 1000 (e.g., 1.1G)
df -h
# Info on installed distro/OS
cat /etc/os-release

### LVM (LogicaL Volume Management)

```Bash
find . -type f -name "*lvm*"
```

LVM is an additional logical layer on top of partitions.

LVM uses the acronym PV to represent a physical volume, VG for volume groups (collections of one or more physical volumes), and LV for logical volumes.

- Disks > Physical volumes / Partitions
- Logical Volumes > Volume Groups (can combine various disks)
- Mount points

```Bash
pvcreate
# To create a new volume group, you use the vgcreate command and specify the name youâd like to give your group and the physical partitions you want to include:
sudo vgcreate my-new-vg /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdb3
```

### Distributions

Debian and RedHat - two big parents/branches from which other distros are forked.

cat /etc/os-release

Ubuntu releases every 6 month 22.04 > 22.10 > 23.04 (+6M step)
Every 2 years LTS version, i.e. version which has 3 years support, others 18 months.
Ubuntu code names - Adjective + Animal starting from the same letter

Debian - codenames Toy Story chars

```Bash
# locate VS find
locate
# find has lots of options - where & what to search + fitltros
find /mnt -type f -name "abc*.pdf"
find / -type f -name "abc*.pdf"
find / -type f -name "abc*.pdf" -size +1M 
find /etc/ -maxdepth -type f -name "*.conf"
find / -maxdepth 2 -type f -name "*.conf"
```

## 08 28.09.2022

reload VS restart: reload - re-read config file, restart - restart service (interruption, dropping active connections)

```Bash
sudo system set-default reboot.target
# units
# vendor - e.g. vsftpd.service etc.
# /usr/lib/systemd/system/
# custom
# /etc/systemd/system -

After updating package list run sudo apt-get update

RedHad derived systems do not have local repo cache.

apt-get install apache

Debian
- apt-get update - updates list of available packages
- apt-get upgrade - update installed packages

RedHat (yum)
- yum update - update packages + preserve obsolete packages
- yum upgrade - update packages + delete obsolete packages

### GRUB

#### GRUB Legacy vs. GRUB 2

The original version of GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader), now known as GRUB Legacy was developed in 1995 as part of the GNU Hurd project, and later was adopted as the default boot loader of many Linux distributions, replacing earlier alternatives such as LILO.

```Bash
#grub>
# list/identify devices
ls
#
```

```Bash
# List libraries used by program
ldd
# LD_LIBRARY - variable to add routes to search for libreries
# ld.so.config - config file to add additional routes to search for libraries (global)
```

### 102.4 Use Debian package management

```Bash
# directory you can add files with additional repositories to be used by APT, without the need to modify the main /etc/apt/sources.list file
/etc/apt/sources.list
# install a .deb package
dpkg -i <package_name>
# dpkg-reconfigure
# apt-get
# apt-cache
```

Debian Package Managers

- **dpkg** - Debian package format (.deb) and its package tool (dpkg), they are widely used not only on Debian itself, but also on its derivatives, like Ubuntu and those derived from it.
- **Advanced Package Tool (apt)** - another package management tool that is popular on Debian-based systems, can streamline many of the aspects of the installation, maintenance and removal of packages, making it much easier.

The Advanced Package Tool (APT) is a package management system, including a set of tools, that greatly simplifies package installation, upgrade, removal and management. APT provides features like advanced search capabilities and automatic dependency resolution. APT is not a âsubstituteâ for dpkg. You may think of it as **a âfront endâ, streamlining operations and filling gaps in dpkg functionality, like dependency resolution**.

### 102.5 Use RPM and YUM package management

- **RPM Package Manager (rpm)** - is the essential tool for managing software packages on Red Hat based (or derived) systems.
- **YellowDog Updater Modified (YUM)** - yum was originally developed as the Yellow Dog Updater (YUP), a tool for package management on the Yellow Dog Linux distribution. Over time, it evolved to manage packages on other RPM based systems, such as Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Oracle Linux.

#### TCP VS UDP (Layer 4)

| TCP                                           | UDP                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - Connection oriented                         | - Not connection oriented                                                  |
| - Confirmation of transfer                    | - No confirmation                                                          |
| - Re-try/re-transfer                          |                                                                            |
| - Priority: data integrity (email, web pages) | Priority: latency/speed, loosing some packets acceptable (streaming, VoIP) |

OSI/TCP-IP - layered models which split tasks/work between different layers

#### ICMP (Layer 4)

ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol, ping

ping - check if connectivity works/exists, response time, packet lose rate and whether target machine/device is up

```
for i in 'cat ports'
```

#### IPv4

Notation: 4 octets of 8 bits = 32 bits address

Address space: 2^32 = 4,294,967,296

Classes:
A 0-127 / 0 MASK 8
B 128-191 / 10 MASK 16, max hosts = 65,534
C 192-223 / 110 MASK 24, max hosts = 
D 224-239 / 111

8 bit mask, 24 bit host, max N of hosts 2^24 = 16,000,000

Private IPs are non routable (stay within LAN), public IPs are routable.

**APIPA**

In computer networking, a link-local address is a network address that is valid only for communications within the subnetwork that the host is connected to. Link-local addresses are most often assigned automatically with a process known as **stateless address autoconfiguration** or **link-local address autoconfiguration**, also known as **automatic private IP addressing (APIPA)** or **auto-IP**.

Link-local addresses are not guaranteed to be unique beyond their network segment. Therefore, routers do not forward packets with link-local source or destination addresses.

IPv4 link-local addresses are assigned from address block **169.254.0.0/16 (169.254.0.0 through 169.254.255.255)**. In IPv6, they are assigned from the block **fe80::/10**.

```Bash
ipcalc 192.167.22.12/23
```

16 bit x 8 = 128 bit, : as a separator

32 hexadecimal symbols

Compression/abbreviation rules:
- Leading 0s can be omitted
- Sequence of 0s - ::, once per address

Network prefixes
- IPv4  - we use prefixes 255.255.255.0 or /24 etc.
- IPv6 - /64 half of address goes to subnet mask, we only use prefixes (/N)

2001.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0001 = 2001::1

- No broadcast concept, only unicast
- 2000::/3
- Global unicast - similar to public IPv4 - unique & routed, all which start from 001 (binary) - 2000::/3 to 3FFF::/3
- Modified EUI-64 Format - creates host part based on 48-bit MAC address


Subnetting

- /16 /32 /48 /64 /80 /96 /112
- Local-link

Exam IPv6 questions:
- IPv6 notation
- Contraction/abbreviation rules
- Masking (only prefix masks)
- Global unicast prefix - 
- Link local prefix - FE80 - FEFF
