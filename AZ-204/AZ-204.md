## Develop Azure compute solutions - 25-30%

Various options of hosting of your workloads in the cloud.

### Azure Compute Solutions

#### Choosing Services - Decision Factors

- Price
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Infrastructure responsibility level (from IaaS to Serverless)

#### IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** allows you to provision, manage, and use cloud-based infrastructure.
    - HW is managed for you, you manage infra (VMs and so on)
    - Pay for run time - idle run included

- **VMs** - classic IaaS solution  (compute resource)
    - Provisioning options
        - Hardware
        - Size - HW specs/price
        - Communication
        - Resiliency - no redundancy, AZ, Availability Set
        - Image = OS
        - Disks
            - Managed (recommended) - underlying storage, availability, security and scaling - ALL IS MANAGED FOR YOU
            - Unmanaged - EVERYTHING IS MANAGED BY YOU
        - Configuration for remote access
    - Provisioning from portal/from CLI
- **Azure Container Services** - except of AKS (not in scope for AZ-204, was in scope for retired exam AZ-203)
    - **Docker** - to create container images which then used to create container instance(s)
    - **Azure Contianer Registry (ACR)** - private registry for storage and management of the images
    - **Azure Container Instance (ACI)** -simplest way to run an image without any infra management
    - With the help of the above 3 tools we can work with containers and images:
            - Create
            - Store
            - Manage
            - Deploy
            - Run

#### PaaS

- **Azure App Service** - a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling your **web apps**. Web apps hosting option (similar to AWS Elastic Beanstalk) & one of the oldest/longest supported Azure services which serves over 40 billion requests every day
    - Create/monitor/manage
        - Publish - Code/Docker container
        - Publish stack
        - Runtime stack - Linux/Windows
    - Deployment - Linux/Windows/Bring Your Own Code/Containers
    - Scaling
        - App service plan - determines location, features, cost and compute resources available to your app
            - SKU (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, Isolated) & size
                - SKU 
                    - Free - try for free
                    - Shared - shared env for dev/test
                    - Basic - dedicated env for dev/test
                    - Standard - env for production workloads
                    - Premium - enchanced performance and scale
                    - Isolated - high-perfromance, security & isolation
    - App insights - for logging and monitoring

**KNOW FOR EXAM**:
- New web app set up
- How to setup a new job inside a web app (with C# SDK)
- Monitoring using app inights
- Application settings
- Setting up new WebJobs
- Deploying code
- Autoscaling rules implementation (on schedule or triggered by metrics)

#### Serverless - host your workloads without managing any servers or infra, you only define work/provide code

- Pay for compute time - only code execution time = lower costs if compared with IaaS/PaaS
- No infrastructure management
- Focus on workload design

- **Azure Functions** - an event-based offering for carrying out serverless computations (main Azure serverless option)
    - Event based solution with a range of triggers
    - Implementation
    - Triggers
        - Timers
        - Data Operations (something added to a Storage Queue or Blob Storage)
        - Webhooks
       ```C#
       // Function trigger example with schedule set to every 5 minutes
       [FunctionName("TimetTriggerExample")]
       public static void Run(
            // Schedule syntax: Second-Minute-Hour-Day-Month-Day of the Week - 6 values
            [TimerTrigger("O */5 * * * *")]TimerInfo myTimer,
            ILogger log)
       {
            log.LogInformation($"Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
       }
       ```
    - Input and Output Bindings - to connect function with other services (storage blobs, CosmosDB, Event Grid, etc.) - blob and queue storage are most frequently used
      ```C#
      // Function binding example
      [FunctionName("BindingExample")]
      [return: Queue("queueOutput")]
      public static void Run(
        [TimerTrigger("0 */5 * * * *")]TimerInfo myTimer,
        [Blob("data", FileAccess.Read)] Stream input,
        ILogger log)
      {
        log.LogInormation($"C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
        using StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(input);
        return reader.ReadToEnd();
       }
      ```
    - Durable functions - used for long-running stateful orchestration of async operations
        - From durable function we call asynchronous activity functions

## Develop for Azure storage - 15-20%

Where to store inputs/outputs for workloads you support/run. Deciding factors:
- Price
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Query type (streaming, analytics)
- Data type (structured, unstructured)

AZ-204 scope includes Cosmos DB and Azure Blob storage types.

### Cosmos DB

**Cosmos DB** - fully-managed NoSQL data storage solution.

- NoSQL = Not-Only SQL
    - type of databases which are used for storing nonrelational data (flexibal schima and other than tabular data store format)
    - high throughput (as there is no/or lesser need for engine to apply locks to ensure consistency)
- CosmosDB pros
    - low latency
    - high throughput
    - global consistency
- CosmosDB cons
    - Cost - very high for high volumes of data, partially alleviated by Serverless pricing (not in scope for AZ-204)

- Cosmos DB account includes 3 levels (creation order):
    - Databases (multiple per account, top level management point for containers/collection of containers)
    - Containers (multiple per database, collection of items) - partitioning ans scaling are implemented on this level
    - Items (actual data/documents stored within containers)

- Partitioning implemented on container level
    - Identify partition keys based on scenario

- APIs
    - Core (SQL) API - query documents using SQL-like syntax
    - Gremlin (Graph) API - for interconnected documents with a graph-like structure
    - Storage-like APIs
        - MongoDB
        - Cassandra
        - Table storage

- Consistently levels
- Querying (using stored procedures, triggers and change feed notifications)
- Data stored as binary BLOBs and can be organized into containers (but it is stored in a flat structure)
- Use cases: static contents, content delivery, logs, back ups
 
    
### Azure Blob Storage

- Part of Azure Storage offering (Table, Blob, Queue, Files, Disks)
- Storage optimized for storing large amounts of unstructured data

- Required knowledge:
    - Data management
    - Data access
    - SDKs
    - Retention and data lifecycle / archiving options

AZ-203 used to include table storage & relational database but they are not included in AZ-204.

- Transient failure (handling with defensive code)

## Connect to and consume Azure services and third-party services 15-20%

### Azure Logic Apps

- Create templates

### Azure APIM

- Configure authentication
- Configure policies

### Event-based solutions

- Azure Event Grid
- Azure Event Hubs
- Notifications Hubs

### Message-based systems

- Azure Service Bus

    - Azure CLI
    - .NET SDK

- NO NEED to recognize exact syntax
- NEED to know outline and ordering
