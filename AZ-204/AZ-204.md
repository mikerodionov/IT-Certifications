Exam is focused on designing, building, testing and maintaining Azure solutions

## Develop Azure compute solutions - 25-30%

Various options of hosting of your workloads in the cloud.

### Choosing Services - Decision Factors

- Price
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Infrastructure responsibility level (from IaaS to Serverless)

### Azure Compute Solutions

#### IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) allows you to provision, manage and use cloud-based infrastructure.

- Pay for run time - idle run included

- VMs - classic IaaS solution  (compute resource)
    - Hardware
    - Size - HW specs/price
    - Communication
    - Resiliency - no redundancy, AZ, Availability Set
    - Image = OS
    - Disks
        - Managed (recommended) - underlying storage, availability, security and scaling - ALL IS MANAGED FOR YOU
        - Unmanaged - EVERYTHING IS MANAGED BY YOU
    - Provisioning - portal/CLI
- Containers - with exception of AKS (not in scope for AZ-204, was in scope for retired exam AZ-203)
    - Docker - to create container images which then used to create container instances
    - Azure Contianer Registry (ACR) - private registry for storage and management of the images
    - Azure Container Instance (ACI) -simplest way to run an image without any infra management
        - With the help of above we can work with containers and images:
            - Create
            - Store
            - Manage
            - Deploy
            - Run

#### PaaS

- Azure Web Apps / App Service -  a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling your web apps. Web apps hosting options (similar to AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
    - Create/monitor/manage
    - Deployment - Linux/Windows/Bring Your Own Code
    - Scaling

#### Serverless - host your workloads without managing any servers or infra, you only define work/provide code

- Pay for compute time - only code execution time

- Azure Functions - an event-based offering carrying out serverless computations (main Azure serverless option)
    - Implementation
    - Triggers
    - Durable functions (used for stateful orchestration of async operations)


## Develop for Azure storage - 15-20%

### Cosmos DB
    - APIs
    - Consistently levels
    - Querying (using stored procedures, triggers and change feed notifications)
### Azure Blob Storage
    - Manage
    - Access (SDKs available)
    - Retention and data lifecycle

## Implement Azure security - 20-25%

### Authentication and authorization
    - OAuth
    - SAS tokens
    - Azure AD
    - RBAC
### Access Azure Resources
    - Azure App Configuration
    - Azure Key Vault
    - Managed Identities

## Monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize Azure solutions - 15-20%

### Content Delivery and caching

- Content delivery networks
- Azure Cache for Redis

### Monitoring Azure Resources

- Application Insights
- Azure Monitor
- Transient failure (handling with defensive code)

## Connect to and consume Azure services and third-party services 15-20%

### Azure Logic Apps

- Create custom connectors
- Create templates

### Azure APIM

- Configure authentication
- Configure policies

### Event-based solutions

- Azure Event Grid
- Azure Event Hubs
- Notifications Hubs

### Message-based systems

- Azure Service Bus
- Azure Storage Queues

### Automation Tools

- Command-line and SDK knowledge
    - Azure CLI
    - .NET SDK

- NO NEED to recognize exact syntax
- NEED to know outline and ordering
